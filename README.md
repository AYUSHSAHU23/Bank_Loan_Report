# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1.**Total Loan Applications:** This means we count how many people apply for loans within a specific time. it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2.**Total Funded Amount:** We want to know the total money given out as loans. It's important to see how much money was given out this month and compare it to previous months.

3.**Total Amount Received:** This is about keeping track of all the money we receive back from borrowers who took loans. We need to see how much money we've received this month and compare it to previous months.

4.**Average Interest Rate:** We calculate the average interest rate of all the loans we give out. We also want to see if this average interest rate changes from month to month.

5.**Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** This is about figuring out the average financial health of our borrowers by looking at their debt compared to their income. We need to calculate the average DTI for all loans, see how it changes this month, and compare it to previous months.

6.**Good Loan Metrics:** Measure performance of 'Good Loans' including application percentage, funded amount, and total received amount.

7.**Bad Loan Metrics:** Measure performance of 'Bad Loans' including application percentage, funded amount, and total received amount.

# Insights:
If you see in the **Good Loan** we can see the funded amount is 370 million which given by the bank in the form of loan. And they are receiving bag from the particular customers is 435.8 million.. so as you can see the difference in the amount. So bank is in profit in here...And 

In the case of **bad loans**, the value extended to customers amounts to 65.5 million, yet the bank has only received 37.3 million in repayments. This indicates a loss for the bank, emphasizing the necessity to avoid such loan applications
