# Bank_Loan_Report
**Description:** The Bank Loan Report project aims to develop an insightful analysis tool for monitoring and assessing lending activities and performance within our bank. By analyzing key loan-related metrics, the report facilitates data-driven decisions and strategic planning to optimize lending strategies.

**OBJECTIVES:** In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1.**Total Loan Applications:** This means we count how many people apply for loans within a specific time. it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2.**Total Funded Amount:** We want to know the total money given out as loans. It's important to see how much money was given out this month and compare it to previous months.

3.**Total Amount Received:** This is about keeping track of all the money we receive back from borrowers who took loans. We need to see how much money we've received this month and compare it to previous months.

4.**Average Interest Rate:** We calculate the average interest rate of all the loans we give out. We also want to see if this average interest rate changes from month to month.

5.**Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** This is about figuring out the average financial health of our borrowers by looking at their debt compared to their income. We need to calculate the average DTI for all loans, see how it changes this month, and compare it to previous months.

6.**Good Loan Metrics:** Measure performance of 'Good Loans' including application percentage, funded amount, and total received amount.

7.**Bad Loan Metrics:** Measure performance of 'Bad Loans' including application percentage, funded amount, and total received amount.
